week[0]= "Your due date will be calculated from the first day of your last menstrual period. Conception occurs about two weeks from this day, and that's when you're truly considered pregnant. In just 40 short weeks, your baby will grow from the size of a tiny seed to the size of a plump watermelon. Baby? What baby? This concept may be a little hard to wrap your head around, but even though you're technically in the first week of pregnancy, you're not quite expecting -- yet. Here's the deal: Because it's generally impossible to know the exact moment of conception, most healthcare providers count 40 weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP) to calculate your due date. According to this method, they date the beginning of 'pregnancy' from about two weeks before the sperm penetrates the egg -- which is where you are right now.";
week[1]= "So far your baby doesn't exist, but this is the week you ovulate. Your ovary releases a ripened egg (ovum) into your fallopian tube, where it will patiently await the sperm that have survived the 6- to 8-inch trek through your cervix and uterus. While 75 to 900 million sperm embark on this journey, less than a thousand actually make it past your cervix -- and only one lucky swimmer will have the honor of penetrating the egg at the moment of conception.";
week[2]= "Amazingly, your child's sex and all of her inherited genetic characteristics -- such as eye color, hair color, skin, and body type -- have been set since the moment of conception. Your developing baby, now called a zygote, has 46 chromosomes -- 23 from you and 23 from your partner. These chromosomes help determine your baby's sex and traits such as eye and hair color, and, to some extent, personality and intelligence. After fertilization, the ball of cells, now an embryo, will wrap up its journey through the fallopian tube and burrow itself into the wall of your uterus for nourishment -- a process known as implantation. If you're having multiples, the deed has already been done. Fraternal twins occur when two separate eggs are fertilized by two different sperm and each baby has his own placenta and amniotic sac. If one fertilized egg splits and develops into two fetuses, the result is identical twins. They may share a placenta, but each baby usually has a separate amniotic sac.";
week[3]= "Your fertilized egg, known as a zygote, is a ball of 32 cells that's about the size of a poppy seed. It's at this stage that the cells separate into three distinct layers from which your baby's internal organs and skin will develop. So what's going on in your womb this week? Your embryo may be minuscule, but trust us: Super-important developments are already under way. This week the embryo splits into two parts. One half will become the placenta, a special tissue that delivers must-have nutrients and oxygen to your baby throughout your entire pregnancy. In the other half, the embryo itself continues to grow, and a sheet of cells has just begun to create the neural tube, where your baby's brain, spinal cord and backbone will ultimately form.";
week[4]= "The ball of cells now resembles a tadpole and is as big as a peppercorn. The creation of the brain, spinal cord, heart, and blood vessels is already well under way. This week, your baby's ticker will start beating for the first time! (Neither you nor your doctor can hear it yet, but it may be possible to see the movement on an ultrasound.) And your little one has been really busy growing! The embryo now has three distinct layers: the outer ectoderm, which will form the nervous system, ears, eyes, inner ear and many connective tissues; the endoderm, or inner layer, which will grow into internal organs like the lungs, intestines and bladder; and the middle mesoderm, which will eventually make way for the heart and circulatory system. In the weeks to come, the mesoderm will also evolve into bones, muscles, kidneys and reproductive organs.";
week[5]= "Your little one has tripled in size and is protected by amniotic fluid. Although he's grown by leaps and bounds, he's still only about the size of a pomegranate seed. By the end of this week your baby will have tripled in size! His heart is now beating with a regular rhythm. It's still too faint to be picked up by your doctor's stethoscope, but if you have an ultrasound at some point over the next few weeks it will probably be visible as a tiny, pulsing dot in the middle of his mini body. Fun fact: From now until birth, your child's heart will beat about 150 times a minute -- twice the average adult rate. Also this week, your baby's brain hemispheres are forming -- and brain waves can now be recorded.";
week[6]= "Your baby is now about the size of a small blueberry. Her arm buds, which formed last week, now look like paddles. Your baby is already developing amazingly distinct facial features. Dark spots mark the areas where her eyes and nostrils will be, and a little mouth and ears are starting to form, too. Your baby's brain is also growing more complex; if you could take a peek, it would be clearly visible inside the transparent skull. In fact, nerve cells in your baby's brain are growing at an amazing rate -- 100,000 cells per minute! And she's started to move in small, jerky motions, although you won't feel these movements until about your fourth month of pregnancy.";
week[7]= "Your baby is about the size of a raspberry. His hands and feet have webbed fingers and toes. Soon this extra tissue between his digits will be reabsorbed to reveal individual fingers and toes. Your baby's growth spurt continues: In the last two weeks he has quadrupled in size. As he gets bigger, his delicate facial features are becoming more refined, with his ears, upper lip, and the teeny tip of his nose all clearly visible. His eyelids will also take shape for the first time this week and his heart is growing stronger by the day.";
week[8]= "Your baby has graduated from embryo to fetus—and is now about the size of a cherry. The digestive tract and reproductive organs are formed, but it's still too early for even a skilled technician to tell whether you're having a boy or a girl. Even though you still have to wait another eight weeks to find out if your new addition will be a boy or a girl, this week, your baby gets the goods she'll need to, well, make her own baby one day. That's right -- reproductive organs are beginning to form now, along with some other key organs, like the pancreas and gallbladder. At this point your baby has doubled in size and her head, which is about half the length of her entire body, is tucked down toward her chest. Her tiny fingers are growing longer, and the ends are slightly enlarged right now -- this is where those unique fingerprints will ultimately form.";
week[9]= "Your baby is about the size of a kumquat and can stretch his spine. Her eyes and eyelids are more developed and her eyebrows are beginning to grow. Up until now your baby was classified as an embryo, but by the end of this week he will be a fetus and lots of changes are on the way. Paddle-like, or webbed, hands and feet will now separate into fingers and toes, bones will begin to harden and his kidneys are now producing urine. Most impressive? At this point your baby's brain is developing at astounding rates -- nearly 250,000 neurons are forming every minute! The end of the embryonic stage also marks a turning point for development dangers -- your baby is much less susceptible to them now.";
week[10]= "Your baby is about the size of a fig. From now through week 20 of your pregnancy, he'll increase 30-fold in weight and triple in length. Did you know your baby can breathe underwater? She's doing it right now. At weeks 10 and 11, the fetus will start to inhale and exhale small amounts of amniotic fluid, which helps your baby's lungs to grow and develop. Also this week, your baby's ears are scooting up to the sides of his head. Sure, your baby's head is still disproportionally large compared to the rest of his body, but this will even out as he continues to grow and develop in the womb.";
week[11]= "Your baby is almost three inches long now, about the size of a lime. Fingernails, toenails, and bones are forming, and a fine layer of hair covers most of her body. As your baby's muscles start to bulk up at this stage, he's getting busy stretching and kicking. When you put your hand on your belly, your baby will likely wiggle in response because his reflexes are starting to develop -- though it's too early to feel his movements. He'll also start to open and close his fingers, curl his toes, and jerk and kick his arms and legs.";
week[12]= "Your beautiful baby is the size of a Meyer lemon this week—and his vocal cords are beginning to develop. Your baby is constantly getting bigger and cuter, and his face is looking more human-like every day. His ears have moved up from his neck into place and his eyes -- which are looking more and more like your baby blues (or browns, or greens) -- have moved from the sides of the head to the front of the face. Up until now, his head has been outpacing his body, but now his body is growing faster. His legs still need to grow longer, but this week his arms will lengthen to be proportionate with his body, and he'll be able to stick his thumb in his mouth. Also by now, all of your baby's essential organs and systems have formed.";
week[13]= "As you enter your second trimester, your baby is the size of a peach. All of her internal organs formed during the first trimester, and they will continue to mature from now until she's born. The roof of your baby's tiny mouth is fully formed now, and her constant sucking reflexes are helping to create full, cherubic cheeks. If you're having a boy, the prostate is forming, and if you're having a girl, her ovaries are moving down into her pelvis. Your baby is almost fully formed now. Although she weighs just under 2 ounces, that will change rapidly in the weeks ahead. She'll soon be much longer than her current 3 or 4 inches. She now has a recognizable neck, and her head sits up a bit from her chest. Because her head has grown, her eyes are closer together over the bridge of her nose.";
week[14]= "Your baby is now the size of an apple. His brain now controls all the muscles in her body; he is able to move. Yes, he'll even do somersaults! But if this is your first baby, you probably won't feel him moving for several more weeks. Lanugo, your baby's first ultrafine, downy hair, now covers his back, shoulders, ears, and forehead. It helps him retain body heat, but once he gains enough fat to do the job, this hair will fall off -- probably before birth. Facial expressions are your baby's newest trick -- he can frown, squint, grimace and wince. Don't worry -- he's just flexing his facial muscles, not indicating his mood.";
week[15]= "Your baby is now the size of an avocado—and she can make a fist and even suck her thumb. Your baby's delicate skeleton continues to harden from rubbery cartilage to bone. Even so, his bones will remain somewhat flexible for an easier trip through the birth canal. The umbilical cord has fully matured with one vein and two arteries that are protected by Wharton's jelly (a thick substance that makes the cord slippery so it can move freely around your baby). By the way, if you're having a girl, hundreds of thousands of eggs are forming in her ovaries this week -- your future grandchildren!";
week[16]= "Your baby is now the size of a pear. He has hiccupped before, but this is the first time you might feel it. Finally, your baby's arms, legs, and trunk have caught up to the size of his head. Baby starts plumping up this week, as body fat is deposited under his skin and sweat glands develop. Also worth noting: The placenta is almost as big as your baby. It provides vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and oxygen, along with removing waste and filtering carbon dioxide.";
week[17]= "Your baby is now about the size of a small artichoke—and her tiny fingers now have unique fingerprints! Do you and your partner talk to your baby? Well, with the bones and nerves in her ears now developed enough to function, she can hear all sorts of sounds -- including blood coursing through the umbilical cord, your growling tummy, and your heartbeat. In fact, sudden or loud noises may startle her. Go ahead and sing, tell stories or play music for your baby now. Even though your baby doesn't understand what these sounds are now, eventually she'll recognize your voice better than any other.";
week[18]= "Your baby is now about the size of a mango. His legs are now longer than his arms, and he'll start giving you 'hello' jabs at regular intervals, which you may be able to feel if this is your second or third pregnancy. First-time moms still might not feel anything for a few more weeks. Vernix caseosa begins to coat the skin. The greasy, cheese-like white coating helps regulate body temperature and protects your baby's skin while it's submerged in amniotic fluid. By the time your baby is born, most of the vernix will be gone. Your baby's heartbeat is growing stronger now and it's about twice as fast as yours.";
week[19]= "Your baby is now the size of a banana. She may have thin eyebrows and is sprouting some hair on her head. Your baby is really making himself known now, popping you with his feet or fists whenever he feels like turning or twisting around, which may seem to happen more at night than any other time of day. At this time, he still has plenty of room to perform somersaults. (Lucky you!) At nearly 10 inches long, your baby is looking more human by the day. Specific areas in his brain are developing for each of his five senses, and his skin is now developing its various layers. Hair and nail growth continue too. An ultrasound might show him swallowing amniotic fluid, an action that helps his digestive system develop. Some researchers speculate that the amniotic fluid contributes nutrients to your developing baby.";
week[20]= "Your baby is as long as a carrot, and his skin now responds to touch. If you put pressure on your belly, he'll move away or push back. Congratulations! You're officially halfway through your pregnancy! Your baby is halfway to her birth size too, measuring an amazing 9 or 10 inches long and growing fast. It seems like she hardly ever sleeps now that she's big enough to be felt, though in reality a baby kicks only several times per hour, then sleeps for a period of time, awakens, and kicks some more. Because she still has room to move in your uterus, you'll feel the kicks in random places. At this point, it's tough to tell a foot from a fist. As she continues to plump out, your baby will start to look like a little doll, complete with eyebrows. She's now completely covered with that white, pasty layer of vernix caseosa. Most of that substance will probably disappear before birth, except in certain places like the creases of her neck and behind her knees. Up until this point, her liver and spleen have produced nearly all of her blood cells. The liver will keep doing that until after her birth, and now her bone marrow's getting up to speed, churning out red blood cells as well. As your baby's senses develop, she's becoming increasingly aware of your eating and sleeping habits and of light and noise levels outside your body.";
week[21]= "Your baby is the size of a papaya. Her lungs are developing rapidly, and they will begin making a protein called surfactant, which will help her breathe independently once she's born. Your baby's previously see-through skin will now become opaque. However, it will remain wrinkly, red, and covered in vernix until more fat helps to fill it out. Also this week, he's fine-tuning his sense of touch (thanks to maturing brain cells and nerve endings). Your baby may experiment with these newfound skills by feeling his face or anything else he can get his hands on. This week, your baby's eyebrows start growing and hair will start sprouting on the scalp, but this varies -- your baby may grow a thick head of dark hair or he may enter the world bald.";
week[22]= "Your baby is as big as a sweet potato. His brain and hearing are more developed this week, and he's beginning to recognize your voice. Billions of brain cells will develop in your baby's brain over the next couple of weeks. These will control all of your baby's movements and sensory, and basic life functions like breathing. Also around this time, some major changes are happening with your baby's lungs. Surfactant is being produced, a substance that enables the air sacs to inflate and the lungs to fully expand. Right now he's still breathing amniotic fluid, but when he's born he'll be ready for air.";
week[23]= "Your baby is as long as an ear of corn. Her nostrils are opening now for 'practice breathing'; she'll go through the same motions of real breathing but inhale amniotic fluid instead of air. You might notice that your baby is very busy during the next few weeks. Right now she's small enough to have plenty of room to move and groove in your belly. She may even respond to your soothing voice or the rubbing of your belly by calming down, while loud sounds or a tap on your belly could cause her to become alert. Also, because the balance-controlling inner ear has developed, your baby can finally tell if she's upside down or right side up, so moving around takes on new meaning.";
week[24]= "Your baby is the size of an acorn squash. He's developing a firm grasp and may reach out and grab the umbilical cord. He can also stick out his tongue! Your baby has definite alert and resting periods now. She's still much skinnier than she'll be at birth, but she continues to fill out. By the end of this week she'll probably weigh about 1 1/2 pounds. Her eyes are open now, perhaps even blinking and closing when she sleeps. The nerves around her mouth are becoming sensitive as she prepares to be able to suckle and nourish her own body after birth. For now, though, you're still nourishing your unborn child via the umbilical cord; your blood carries nutrients to your baby through the cord, which consists of a single vein and two arteries. The umbilical cord is protected against your baby's gymnastics by Wharton's jelly -- a gelatinous goo that keeps the umbilical cord from twisting and knotting as your baby continues to test her muscles and find things to occupy her waking time. As your baby grows, so does her brain. Deeper grooves and furrows are developing in her cerebral cortex, which is going to be Command Central for many important functions including her ability to see, hear, smell, speak, and walk. Already her brain controls her rhythmic breathing, digestion, and body temperature; these three activities are essential in order for your baby to be able to live outside your body.";
week[25]= "Your baby is nearly as long as a zucchini. Her eyebrows and eyelashes are well-defined; plus, she has more hair on her head this week. You loved feeling those delightful first kicks. Now, however, you're more likely to say 'ouch' as your baby's length passes the 14-inch mark and his weight climbs to nearly 2 pounds. In fact his movements are so strong that your partner should be able to feel them easily. Your partner might even hear your baby's heartbeat if he puts his head on your belly. Your baby is probably still in the breech position (head up) at this point because your pear-shape uterus offers him more legroom that way. Although he's still wrinkly, your baby is now at 25 percent of his expected birthweight, and he's going to really pile on the ounces in the next couple of months. His spine is getting stronger, and if he were born now, he would have an 80 percent chance of survival. He's now capable of inhaling, exhaling, and even crying. That lanugo hair that grew all over his body is rapidly disappearing, and it will probably be completely gone by the end of the 7th month except for some fuzz on his back and shoulders. Your baby's eyes are becoming more sensitive; if you were to shine a light on your belly, he would notice.";
week[26]= "Your baby is now the size of a cauliflower. At this point, he may be able to distinguish between your voice and your husband's or partner's voice. Your baby is getting downright chubby as fat deposits continue accumulating beneath her skin, which looks pink because blood vessels are so close to the surface. She'll rely on those fat deposits after she's born to provide energy and insulate her against cold. By the end of this week, she'll probably weigh more than 2 pounds. The placenta is now almost fully developed. Your baby is still kicking so much that you might worry if she's suddenly quiet. Don't. How much a baby kicks has more to do with her personality than with her health. If you want to reassure yourself that everything is fine, you can do an average ‘kick count.’ Lie on your left side -- usually early evening after you've eaten is the best time -- and check to see how long it takes to feel 10 movements. Do that every day for a week; then average the number of kicks to see what you should expect. Remember too that your baby's movements will naturally change as you enter your 9th month and her bedroom becomes more cramped.";
week[27]= "Until now, your baby's eyelids have been fused shut, but this week he'll begin to open and close his eyes. What's more, his irises are now filled with pigment. Even if you could peek at the color of his peepers now, though, they might not stay that color, as a baby's eyes can change up until he's 6 months to 1 year old (especially if your little guy is born with baby blues). If your baby is a boy, his testes will soon descend into his scrotum. Your baby's brain is developing rapidly right now. An ultrasound of your baby at 28 weeks shows a head that is large in proportion to his body; at birth a human baby's brain accounts for a whopping 12 percent of his body weight. Your baby already has the 100 billion or so brain cells he'll have at birth. However, he still has to build connections between them to form the neurological network that will give him control over everything from his footsteps to his speech.";
week[28]= "Your baby is the size of a large butternut squash. His skin is still wrinkly, but as fat accumulates, he will fill out. Your baby's hearing is so well developed by now that she will startle at loud noises. Soon she'll start turning her head to listen to sounds outside your body. By now your baby weighs well over 2-1/2 pounds and most likely measures about 15 inches long. She's beginning to store enough fat beneath her lovely pink skin that she may already have those baby dimples on her elbows and knees. If your baby is a girl, she'll probably weigh less at birth than if you are carrying a boy; either way, your baby will probably weigh between 7 and 7-1/2 pounds at birth. If this is your second or third pregnancy, you can expect this baby to weigh more than your last. As she runs out of room, your baby may bow her head down toward her knees, curling as she did when she was very tiny. She's long enough now that you'll notice her kicks more. Forget those little fluttery motions. This feels more like someone is elbowing you for space on the subway! Play 'guess that body part' with your partner as you try to distinguish a knee from a heel.";
week[29]= "Your baby is the size of a large cabbage. She has cycles of sleeping and waking. After 30 to 90 minutes of snoozing, she may give you a kick to let you know she's awake. From this point on your baby will gain about a half pound each week. All that baby weight is for more than filling out his chubby cheeks. Now that all of his major body systems are in place and functioning, he needs padding to protect and insulate his organs. His built-up fat tissue will also help him regulate his body temperature after birthand provide the energy he needs. Because your baby is adding fat and growing bigger, you might find his movements become less frequent -- it's getting harder for him to maneuver. But if you're not feeling any jabs or the occasional kick, tell your health care provider.";
week[30]= "Your baby is about the size of a coconut, and she will now gain as much as a half pound per week until she's born. Your baby is gaining more weight than height at this point. Because she's too big to stretch out, she's now forced into the fetal position, which she'll stay in until birth. This this week also boasts some exciting reproductive developments. Having a boy? His testicles are moving through the groin on their way into the scrotum. And if you've got a girl in there, her clitoris is already relatively formed. Your baby may weigh 3 1/2 pounds this week, and he should be 16 inches in length. His belly is Buddha-like, round and hard because his liver is busily producing red blood cells. Some babies have a full head of hair by the 31st week of pregnancy, while others are bald as eggs. It's common for babies to hiccup at this stage and for the hiccups to be strong enough to wake you in the middle of the night.";
week[31]= "Your baby is the size of a Napa cabbage. Because her taste buds are developed, she may acquire a preference for the foods you eat, which she samples when she swallows amniotic fluid. Your baby has definite sleep-and-wake cycles, but she probably sleeps about 70 percent of the time. Ultrasounds reveal that sometime between 32 weeks and 36 weeks babies develop the ability to dream. They have definite periods of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. Your baby also has periods of quiet alertness in which she listens to the exciting sounds beyond her dark room. At almost 4 pounds, your baby is definitely big enough by now to survive outside the womb. Her lungs are maturing, and her heart rate is starting to slow down a bit. However, research shows that the fetal heart rate speeds up if the mother is stressed, so stay as relaxed as you can to help your baby stay peaceful.";
week[32]= "Your baby is the size of a pineapple. Lanugo, the fine hair that covered her entire body and helped keep her warm as she developed, is starting to disappear, but there might still be patches of it on her shoulders and back. During these final weeks of pregnancy, your baby enters his 'finishing period.' This is exactly what it sounds like: Your baby's organs, skeleton, and body are well formed, but he needs a little more time to finish getting ready to take on the world. By now he weighs a good 4-1/2 pounds and measures more than 17 inches long, pushing the height of your uterus nearly to your rib cage. His toenails have completely grown in, as has any hair on his head.Your amniotic fluid level is at its highest about now. The placenta is still providing oxygen to your baby through the umbilical cord, but your baby is practicing his breathing regularly, swallowing amniotic fluid as he opens and closes his mouth and exercising his diaphragm muscle. He continues to store iron in his liver, and the connections between his brain cells keep spreading like tiny tree branches. Neurons and synapses are developing between those brain cells, forming connections so that he'll have the skills to thrive as an infant.";
week[33]= "Your baby is the size of a cantaloupe. Her bones are fully developed by now, and she's turning her head, pirouetting, and moving her body from side to side. Your baby's preparing for his arrival in just a few short weeks! This week, the protective vernix caseosa (that cheese-like, white, waxy coating that's keeping his skin safe) begins to thicken, ensuring that his birthday suit stays smooth and well-moisturized during D-day. Your baby will likely arrive covered in the stuff, especially in the folds under his arms, behind his ears, and in the groin area. But it'll all be washed off very shortly after birth -- during his first-ever bath.";
week[34]= "Your baby is the size of a honeydew melon. In preparation forbirth, he is now upside down in your uterus. At this point, your unborn baby should be positioned with her head facing down toward the cervix and vagina. About 97 percent of babies have adopted this position by this point; the rest remain in what's known as breech position -- when the butt or feet are in place to come out first. If your baby's among this minority, it does increase your odds of needing a C-section, but there's a good chance your healthcare provider can correct the problem by turning him around manually with pressure applied on your belly. Called an external version, this process has about a 65 percent success rate.";
week[35]= "Your baby is about the size of a head of romaine lettuce, and her wrinkly suit of skin is filling out as she gets plumper. Your baby is working hard to accumulate all the fat he can at this point, and that layer of fat has now rounded out his face. This build-up of fat -- about 15 percent of his total weight--will help him maintain his body temperature and give him a store of energy. His sucking muscles, which are quite powerful, have also finished developing now, and are ready for their first real feeding -- your baby's going to be hungry soon after he arrives.";
week[36]= "Your baby is as long as stalk of Swiss chard. Because he's running out of room in your uterus, he mostly stretches and wiggles, instead of delivering big kicks. The umbilical cord begins passing antibodies to your baby in preparation for delivery. By stockpiling antibodies, your baby will be better prepared for the disease and germs he'll encounter outside the womb. Your baby's senses are also getting more time to hone their burgeoning skills. He can hear and recognize your voice. Once he's born you'll be able to see him turn his head in your direction when he hears you speak. He knows his mom! Along with his hearing, his eyesight is improving each day. His fingers are also becoming more coordinated. He can grasp his face or toes. And after birth he'll be able to grab onto your finger.";
week[37]= "Your baby is the length of a leek. Connections are forming in her brain that will help her swallow and even sleep better once she's born. Things are really getting crowded now that your baby might weigh more than 6 pounds and stretch beyond 20 inches. The placenta, too, is nearly as large as it will get, probably measuring between 6 and 8 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. The placenta adds another pound to what's keeping you from tying your shoes. Your baby is so big that her knees and elbows have to be constantly flexed or even folded. However, she'll still wiggle and bump you, so you should be aware of her movements. Her heart rate will be between 120 and 160 beats per minute during labor and delivery. You'll probably also be very aware of her hiccups now. They're the result of your baby inhaling amniotic fluid as she practices her breathing, and they can be vigorous enough for your partner to see your clothes move. Her lungs are most likely fully mature. Your baby's umbilical cord is between 12 and 39 inches long but will most likely be about 21 inches. It looks like a moist, white, twisted telephone cord, and it attaches the placenta to your baby.";
week[38]= "Your baby now weighs as much as a pumpkin. At this point, he has shed most of that white creamy substance called vernix and the fine, fur-like hair called lanugo that has covered his skin since the middle of your second trimester. By now your baby has likely reached his birth weight (typically between 6 and 9 pounds) and length (18 to 22 inches from head to toe). He's accumulated enough body fat to stay cozy after he's born, and your placenta continues to supply him with nutrients and antibodies that will help fend off illnesses. If you could sneak a peek at your baby's final moments before birth, you'd see that his head is down toward your pelvis (if he's not in the bottom-down or breech presentation, in which case your healthcare provider might suggest a cesarean section). Your baby's body will either be straight up and down, called longitudinal, or positioned at an angle, called oblique. Along with spying your baby's body position, if you could see his head, you'd notice that he's head-down and facing your spine, which is the most common position (called anterior presentation). But sometimes, babies present head-down but facing toward your abdomen. This is called occiput or cephalic posterior. Your baby might lean slightly to one side or the other, meaning that he is either 'right' or 'left' anterior, or 'right' or 'left' posterior.";
week[39]= "By the time she's born, your baby may be watermelon-size. You're expecting to give birth this week, but don't worry if your baby decides to stick around a little longer. Many first babies are late, and she'll be worth the wait! When your baby arrives, he will be evaluated and graded (zero to two points each) on the following factors: activity and muscle tone, pulse (heart rate), grimace response (medically known as 'reflex irritability'), appearance (skin coloration) and respiration (breathing rate and effort). This sum will determine the baby's Apgar score -- an initial measure of his health. Most healthy babies have an Apgar between seven and nine (few babies get a 10).";
week[40]= "By the time she's born, your baby may be watermelon-size. You're expecting to give birth this week, but don't worry if your baby decides to stick around a little longer. Many first babies are late, and she'll be worth the wait! As amazing as it is to meet your baby for the first time, don't be alarmed if she's not exactly, um, as good-looking as you imagined she would be. Those delivered vaginally tend to have temporarily misshapen heads and puffy eyes. And your baby will probably be coated with vernix caseosa, but most of it will be washed off during the first bath.
